## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is MichaÅ‚ and I'm from Poland.
I'm a junior electrical engineer and I'm super excited to be working on BIM projects!
I'm the proud graduate of AGH University of Krakow where I got my master's degree in electrical engineering.
I'm also interested in programming to automate projects in environments such as Revit, AutoCAD and Dialux, which I regularly use at work.
I'm keen to combine my programming skills with my job, which I'm sure will improve my work and reduce the time I spend on manual work.
